// THIS FILE IS DEPRECATED.
// All admin actions have been moved to their respective client components
// in the `/src/app/admin/` directory. This was done to correctly handle
// Firestore permissions within the development environment, which lacks
// server-side admin credentials.
// This file is kept for reference but should not be used. It can be removed in a future cleanup.
